## <div id="chapter-1"> [一、摘要](#content-1) 

* Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding principles for Python's design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.

> Beautiful is better than ugly. <br>
> Explicit is better than implicit. <br>
> Simple is better than complex. <br>
> Complex is better than complicated. <br>
> Flat is better than nested. <br>
> Sparse is better than dense. <br>
> Readability counts. <br>
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. <br>
> Although practicality beats purity. <br>
> Errors should never pass silently. <br>
> Unless explicitly silenced. <br>
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. <br>
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. <br>
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. <br>
> Now is better than never. <br>
> Although never is often better than \*right\* now. <br>
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. <br>
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. <br>
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
